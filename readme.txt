== Description ==

= Hello, we are Wuunder =
Hello, we are [Wuunder](https://wearewuunder.com/). We make shipping any parcel, pallet and document easy, personal and efficient. As a business owner, you can book your shipment using your mobile, tablet or computer. We select the best price and pick up your parcel wherever you want. You and the receiver can both track and trace the shipment. You can also stay in contact with each other via our Wuunder chat. Everything without a contract. Why complicate things?

Wuunder is a Transport Management Service that makes your delivery and return proces a key differentiator for your customers. You can send and receive all your parcels, pallets and documents via your own transport contracts or use ours. Wuunder offers pro-active notifications and monitors the complete transport from pick-up until delivery and will contact the sender, carrier or receiver to fix issues.

With this shipping module, you connect your WooCommerce store to your Wuunder account where you can book transport services and print shipping & return labels in one click. The module will send track & trace emails automatically.

Within your WooCommerce admin environment, you can also print the shipping labels and track & trace your shipments.



= Account & pricing =
You need to create a free Wuunder account and request an API-key to use the module. You can download and install the module before you sign-up. With this module you connect your WooCommerce store to your Wuunder account. No need to sign a contract and of course business customers pay afterwards.

As a merchant, you only pay per shipment. When using your own transport contracts you pay a service fee per shipment, when you use our negotiated carrier contracts you pay the cost of shipping. So easy!



= Features =
	• Offer your customers choice by adding multiple carriers to your check-out (sameday, nextday or cheaper). Use the parcelshop locator to ship directly to a parcelshop
	• Use our easy to use shipping module to book automatically your document, parcel or pallet via different carriers like PostNL, DHL Parcel, DPD, FedEx, GLS, RedJePakketje, UPS, TNT, Brenger, Rhenus, Ritmo, etc.  Why be difficult if you can do it easily?

	• Airfreight or Sea-freight import is no problem for us? Full truck loads or less? We take care
	• We ship within and from Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to the rest of the world and back. On request we offer special services from any country
